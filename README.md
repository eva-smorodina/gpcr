# GPCRs

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the most important drug targets including therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Despite importance for clinics, spending enormous R&D costs and decades efforts, very few therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been approved for clinical uses. This is largely due to not only the difficulties of membrane protein expression, purification and stabilization of GPCRs, but also subsequent monoclonal antibody binding assays. 

Here we show:
1) how to automate the transformation of native GPCRs into water-soluble QTY versions
2) how to automate the QTY protocols extraction from your mail
3) how to extract important information from the QTY protocols
4) how to automate the construction of Protter 2D-diagrams
4) how to visualize some GPCRs data and structures
